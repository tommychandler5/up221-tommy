## Introduction
###### Hi there! My name is Tommy Chandler, and I'm a first year MURP concentrating in Design and Development. Mapping and geography - both physical and cultural - are what originally piqued my interest in urban planning. This course is my first introdcution to GIS and Python, and I look forward to learning how to create maps and visuals from various data sources to convey complex topics and urban patterns.
