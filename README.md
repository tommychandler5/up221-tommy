### Bio
###### Hi there! My name is Tommy Chandler, and I'm a first year MURP concentrating in Design and Development. I grew up in the suburbs of Chicago, did my undergrad at Colby College in Maine where I majored in architectural studies, and spent the last 3-4 years working in construction project management at a commercial real estate firm.

### Course Objectives
###### Mapping and geography - both physical and cultural - are two areas that originally piqued my interest in urban planning. This course is my first introdcution to GIS and Python, and I look forward to learning how to create maps and visuals from various data sources to convey complex topics and urban patterns.

### Academic Interests and Project Ideas
###### My academic interests are quite varied, and I don’t have a specific project idea in mind, but I’d like to use this course as an opportunity to integrate my interest in environmental analysis and resilience planning with urban design and development. Some topics i’m interested in exploring and mapping include: 
###### * Disparities in access to public green space
###### * Disparities in risk of extreme heat exposure, wildfires, flooding, and drought and mitigation strategies
###### * Environmental resilience
###### * Sustainable urbanism and infrastructure
###### * Migration and displacement
